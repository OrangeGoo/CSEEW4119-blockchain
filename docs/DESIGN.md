# Blockchain Design Documentation

## 1. Blockchain Design

### 1.1 Block Structure
- Each block contains:
  - Index
  - List of transactions
  - Timestamp
  - Previous block hash
  - Current block hash
  - Nonce (for mining)
  - Difficulty level

### 1.2 Mining Process
- Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm
- Difficulty adjusts based on network conditions
- Mining reward system (optional)

### 1.3 Transaction Validation
- Digital signatures for transaction verification
- Double-spending prevention
- Transaction fee mechanism (optional)

## 2. P2P Network Design

### 2.1 Tracker
- Maintains list of active peers
- Handles peer registration/unregistration
- Provides peer discovery service
- Implements peer health checks

### 2.2 Peer Protocol
- Peer discovery and connection
- Block propagation
- Chain synchronization
- Fork resolution
- Network partitioning handling

### 2.3 Communication Protocol
- REST API for peer-to-peer communication
- JSON message format
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

## 3. Demo Application Design

### 3.1 Voting System
- Secure vote casting
- Vote counting and verification
- Prevention of double voting
